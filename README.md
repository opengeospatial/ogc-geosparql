# OGC GeoSPARQL

## Introduction

This GitHub repository contains [OGC](https://www.ogc.org/)'s [GeoSPARQL standard](https://www.ogc.org/standards/geosparql). It is used to work on updates of that standard.

## Updates of GeoSPARQL

### Rationale
GeoSPARQL 1.0 was published in 2012. Since then the standard has seen considerable uptake. With that came requests for extension and improvement. This has led to the revival of the OGC GeoSPARQL Standards Working Group (SWG). The overall mission of the GeoSPARQL SWG is to ensure that the features of GeoSPARQL remain up-to-date with expectations from the Semantic Web community. For more details, see the [SWG's charter](https://portal.ogc.org/files/93345) and the recently published OGC whitepaper [Benefits of Representing Spatial Data Using Semantic and Graph Technologies](http://docs.ogc.org/wp/19-078r1/19-078r1.html).

### Methodology
The primary set of tasks for the SWG is [the set of change requests for GeoSPARQL in the OGC Issue Tracker](http://ogc.standardstracker.org/requestlist.cgi?component=11-052r4&list_id=1094&product=OGC). All issues reported in the OGC issue tracker should have duplicates in this repository and should be labelled 'change request'.
Not all change requests will be acted upon immediately. At least two updated versions of GeoSPARQL are expected to be released. A first set of change requests will be handled for GeoSPARQL 1.1. This set consists of changes that should only have a minor impact on existing implementations of the standard. More comprehensive changes will be made in later stages, resulting in additional releases. See the [milestones](milestones) for an overview of issues by iteration. 

## Working documents
An index of the working artefacts can be found <a href="https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogc-geosparql/">here</a>. These are built automatically as updates occur. *Note: These are only working documents. Approved documents are published on <a href="https://www.ogc.org/standards/geosparql">the OGC Website</a>.*

### How to get involved
It is the SWG's intention to operate as open and transparent as possible. Different communities or knowledge domains use spatial data on the web and/or in graphs, in one way or antoher. They all stand to benefit from improvement of the GeoSPARQL standard, so participation in development is highly recommended.
Next to making change requests in the OGC Issue Tracker, which is possible for everyone at any time, anyone can participate by commenting on issues in this repository, or adding a new issue. The SWG would particularly want to inivite implementers of the GeoSPARQL standard to get actively involved in working towards optimal new versions of the standard.
