== Purpose of the Standards Working Group

////
Proposers will describe the purpose of the Standards Working Group and its overall mission in relation to OGC processes, the OGC standards baseline, and OGCâ€™s business plan.
////

The purpose of this SWG is to revise, and likely extend, the GeoSPARQL standard.

Its overall mission is to ensure that the features of GeoSPARQL remain up-to-date with the Semantic Web community whose needs now outstrip the current content of GeoSPARQL.

This revision will likely result in a major update of GeoSPARQL that will form a new base Semantic Web standard for people working with spatial data. This should include consideration of backwards-compatibility with GeoSPARQL 1.0 as part of its requirements.
