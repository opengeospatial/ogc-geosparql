Version of 2018-12-12
Some Instructions
This document is the template to be used for proposing the formation of a new Standards Working Group (SWG).

The first step is to complete the SWG Charter for the proposed new SWG.

The next step is to email the draft SWG charter to the Technical Committee Chair (TCC).  The TCC will review the draft charter and make any necessary comments and provide guidance.

Finally, once the Charter is ready, the SWG charter will be posted to the OGC Pending Documents and the vote process in the Technical Committee Policies and Procedures will start.

Any questions, please contact OGC staff.

To: OGC members & interested parties

A new OGC Standards Working Group is being formed. The OGC members listed below have proposed the OGC {swg-name}.  The SWG proposal provided in this document meets the requirements of the OGC Technical Committee (TC) Policies and Procedures.

The SWG name, statement of purpose, scope, list of deliverables, audience, and language specified in the proposal will constitute the SWG's official charter. Technical discussions may occur no sooner than the SWG's first meeting.

This SWG will operate under the OGC IPR Policy. The eligibility requirements for becoming a participant in the SWG at the first meeting (see details below) are that:

* You must be an employee of an OGC member organization or an individual
member of OGC;

* The OGC member must have signed the OGC Membership agreement;

* You must notify the SWG chair of your intent to participate to the first meeting. Members may do so by logging onto the OGC Portal and navigating to the Observer page and clicking on the link for the SWG they wish to join and;

* You must attend meetings of the SWG. The first meeting of this SWG is at the time and date fixed below. Attendance may be by teleconference.

Of course, participants also may join the SWG at any time. The OGC and the SWG welcomes all interested parties.

Non-OGC members who wish to participate may contact us about joining the OGC. In addition, the public may access some of the resources maintained for each SWG: the SWG public description, the SWG Charter, Change Requests, and public comments, which will be linked from the SWGâ€™s page.

Please feel free to forward this announcement to any other appropriate lists. The OGC is an open standards organization; we encourage your feedback.
