| 2033 | Intro | JA | {::nomarkdown}Call for Patents<ul><li>None known</li></ul>Roll Call<ul><li>Attendees recorded in minutes</li><li>Attendees confirmed vocally</li></ul>{:/} |
| <br/> | GeoLD Paper | NC | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Nick is looking to get a conference paper together for GeoLOD  (https://dice-group.github.io/GeoLD2021/) as a way of advertising the new edition of GeoSPARQL to a relevant community</li><li>He’s hoping to cover off on the new things being added to GeoSPARQL 1.1.</li><li>Paper is due 15th March 2021</li><li>Keen to summarise the additions and provide some background on why those things have been added, drawn from the white paper, recent OGC testbeds, etc.</li></ul>{:/} |
| <br/> | Issues without milestone | FK | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>There have been a number of new issues added since we started working on the standard, which have not been assigned a Milestone (e.g., GeoSPARQL 11)[(**Action 1**)](#action_1)</li></ul>{:/} |
| <br/> | GeoSPARQL Implementations | NC | {::nomarkdown}Implementation of the standards<ul><li> Combine emergency data information, e.g., on wildfires. This will include harmonization. We (NC+SC) use GeoSPARQL version 1.1.. Mix of standards including DGGS and GeoJSON. Need to prepare spatial querying functions for these literal types</li><li> Python GeoSPARQL: https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib-geosparql/ </li><li> Will include work as part of the Jena framework that now also supports GeoSPARQL.</li><li> Five people working on this full-time. We will have a public endpoint for the emergency data very soon.</li><li> In addition to an endpoint, there will also be a Linked Data API.</li><li> Time variance will be the next big step, e.g., for GeoSPARQL 2.0</li><li>MB: Strabon paper st-sparql including temporality for wildfires in Greece: http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-35176-1_19 and https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1570826814000031 </li><li> NC: use OWL Time. Allan interval algebra could be integrated to support temporal functions.</li><li> RG: merge owl-time with spatial operations</li><li> KJ: Spatial and temporal scoping may also be of interest to GeoSPARQL 2.0</li><li> NC: Temporal reference systems</li><li> FK: What about discrete global grid systems? There are already tickets, which have been completed, that explore DGGS Literals.</li><li> MB: already ticket for adapting getSRID function to SRS terminology?</li><li> RG: RSID as a combination of spatial and temporal RS IDs.</li><li> TH: need for SPARQL extension function to transform geometry between two SRS?</li><li> NC: function to transform between geometry serializations?</li><li> TH: generic function versus many different pair-wise functions.</li><li> Two issues SRS transformation and serialization transformation [(**Action 2**)](#action_2)</li></ul>{:/}|
| <br/> | GeoSPARQL Compliance Benchmark | TH | Presentation of GeoSPARQL benchmark: what and when? Nothing new to report.|
| 2117 | Review of new issues | JA | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Comments on issues of 1.1 versus 2.0</li><li> NC, KJ, JA: discussion on issue #83 on spatial measures.</li><li> NC we need to push a bit deeper beyond simple comment to address this.</li><li> NC should be 1.1<br/>- Rename SpatialMeasure [#103](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-geosparql/issues/103)</li><li> KJ Metrically defined topological relations  → Egenhofer and Celementini and others have shown for years the need for going beyond crisp RC8 relations and they may be worth investigating at some stage. Maybe 1.2</li><li> FK: [#43](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-geosparql/issues/43) multi-language support → content negotiation</li><li> PI Yes to content negotiation</li><li> NC, JA, KJ: how to support different languages in the GeoSPARQL ontology.</li><li> NC: just annotations so far. There is more here and a lot of research would have to go into this.</li><li> MB: To keep in sync only update other languages than English after milestones.</li><li> RG: Are there any parallels with the TC211 multi-lingual glossary of Terms and the supporting software geolexica? cf https://www.isotc211.org/ for lunks to both</li><li> NC +JA: Do it for 1.1</li><li> KJ to do Polish and German</li><li> FK: to do Dutch</li><li> GW: to do  Portuguese</li><li> FK: [#42](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-geosparql/issues/42) → moved to discovery and 1.2 or 2.0</li><li> MB+JA: How do we deal with RDF* and SPARQL* → moved to questions</li><li> More on geometries and their representation beyond literals → 2.0</li><li> MB [#26](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-geosparql/issues/26) FK widen applications beyond geographic data (3D, any geometry format, binary formats). Might need to implement a restriction to max 1 serialisation per geometry instance  (breaking change) for adding metadata (SRS, number of vertices, etc.) regarding the geometry serialisation. -> 2.0 </li></ul>{:/} |
| <br/> | OGC API - Features - Part 5: Search | PV | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li> https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/tree/master/proposals/search</li><li>MB asks about relations to grlc: https://github.com/CLARIAH/grlc => more focused on SPARQL only while OGC API is broader (SQL, CQL, SPARQL, etc)</li></ul>{:/} |
