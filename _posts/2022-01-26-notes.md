| 2040 | Questions with OGC | JA | <ul><li>Release Notes template: https://github.com/opengeospatial/templates/tree/master/release_notes_template</li><li>Issue [#199](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-geosparql/issues/199): seems from the thread that this one is in work. Given that GML is one of the Standards, resolvable URIs could take quite a while!</li><li>Units of Measure: OGC does not have an “official” reference, but older Standards used UCUM and now most informatively reference QUDT. Given that GeoSPARQL requires a proper, semantic-web-friendly dependency, I think that it would be just fine to limit the reference to QUDT. I can foresee cases where a completely novel set of units could be created and required, so limiting to QUDT may not be ideal.</li></ul> |
