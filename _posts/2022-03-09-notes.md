It’s clear the DWG doesn’t itself need the ontology, but we will need their endorsement to support uptake of the ontology. This DWG was clear that our starting point should be the ISO 19111 GOM Ontology. TH has already made a start, pulling in the Ontology, making a few amendments to support broader use. JA has got agreement from CRS SWG Chair to work with us on constructing a compelling story around those amendments to support endorsement. If interested, please reach out to any of TH, FK, or JA.</li></ul> |
