Bibliography Management

The bibliography of the GeoSPARQL spec is managed in a BibTeX file in the spec folder.
Keys in this BibTeX file can be cited using << >> in the spec and are appended to the bibliography sections
To add a BibTeX entry to the *normative* section of the spec, it needs to be tagged using *category=normative* in the bibtex entry.
