== Conformance
Conformance with this specification shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in <<Annex A - Abstract Test Suite (normative)>>. The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in _ISO 19105: Geographic information â€” Conformance and Testing_ <<ISO19105>>.

This document establishes many individual Requirements and Conformance Classes which contain tests for one or more Requirements. GeoSPARQL implementations need not conform to all Conformance Classes but must state which individual ones they do conform to. GeoSPARQL implementations claiming conformance to a Conformance Class must pass all the tests defined for it in <<Annex A - Abstract Test Suite (normative)>>. 

Requirements and Conformance Class tests have IRIs that are relative to versioned namespace IRIs. Requirements and Conformance Class tests that are defined in GeoSPARQL 1.0 have IRIs relative to  `http://www.opengis.net/spec/geosparql/1.0/` and those added in GeoSPARQL 1.1 have IRIs relative to  `http://www.opengis.net/spec/geosparql/1.1/`.

Many Conformance Classes are parameterized, and any parameters are explained in the detailed clauses for those Conformance Classes.

.Conformance Classes
|===
|Conformance Class | Description | Subclause of the abstract test suite

| Core | Defines top-level spatial vocabulary components | A.1
| Topology Vocabulary Extension | Defines topological relation vocabulary | A.2
| Geometry Extension | Defines geometry vocabulary and non-topological query functions | A.3
| Geometry Extension - DGGS | Defines the properties and functions of the Geometry Extension Conformance Classes for use with Discrete Global Grid System geometry representations | A.3.DGGS
| Geometry Topology Extension | Defines topological query functions for geometry objects | A.4
| RDFS Entailment Extension | Defines a mechanism for matching implicit RDF triples that are derived based on RDF and RDFS semantics | A.5
| Query Rewrite Extension | Defines query transformation rules for computing spatial relations between spatial objects based on their associated geometries | A.6

Dependencies between each GeoSPARQL Conformance Class are shown below in Figure 2. To support a Conformance Class for a given set of parameter values, an implementation must support each dependent Conformance Class with the same set of parameter values.
