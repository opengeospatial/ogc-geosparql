== i.    Preface
The GeoSPARQL standard defines:

* a formal _profile_
* **this specification document**
* a core RDF/OWL ontology for geographic information representation
* a set of SPARQL extension functions
* a Functions & Rules vocabulary, derived from the ontology
* a Simple Features geometry types vocabulary
* a set of RIF rules, and
* SHACL shapes for RDF data validation

This document has the role of _specification_ and authoritatively defines many of the standard's elements, including the ontology classes and properties, SPARQL functions and function and rule vocabulary concepts. Complete descriptions of the standard's parts and their roles are given in the Introduction in the section <<GeoSPARQL Standard structure>>.

=== Major changes between versions 1.0 and 1.1
Version 1.1 of GeoSPARQL was released approximately 9 years after version 1.0. It contains no breaking changes to 1.0, but does contain new features including: whole new profile resources, new ontology elements and new functions. The major changes are summarized in the tables below.

The new profile resources are separate from this specification. The new _profile definition_ lists all the GeoSPARQL 1.1 resources.

|GeoSPARQL Rules in RIF | http://www.opengis.net/def/geosparql-rifrules
|RDF validation file | http://www.opengis.net/def/geosparql-shapes
|===

These new ontology elements and new functions are normatively defined in this specification document.
