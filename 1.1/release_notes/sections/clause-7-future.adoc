== Future Work

As of the release of GeoSPARQL 1.1, the GeoSPARQL Standard Working Group proposes a next minor release of GeoSPARWL 1.2 in late 2022 or early 2023. The SWG is also considering a more major release, perhaps GeoSPARQL 2.0, after that. The intention is that backwards-compatable additions only will be added to GeoSPARQL 1.2 abut potentially major, breaking, changes will be added to GeoSPARQL 2.0.

Determining scope for future GeoSPARQL releases is an open and public process undertaken by the SWG in the course of their regular meetings. 

Release scope is shown by the SWG allocating Issues raised against the Standard in its online source code repository:

* https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-geosparql/issues

Milestones indicate Issue's potential release, for example the https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-geosparql/issues/301[Issue #301 "Handling of Z-coordinates by geometry functions is underspecified"] is allocated Milestone GeoSPARQL 1.2.
