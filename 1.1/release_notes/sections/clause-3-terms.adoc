GeoSPARQL 1.0 contained only acronyms in its Terms & Definitions section, for example:

|===
| GeoJSON | Geographic JavaScript Object Notation
| GFM | General Feature Model (as defined in ISO 19109)

|===

GeoSPARQL 1.1 contains those acronym, with additions such as _Spatial Reference System_ (SRS), but it also contains a list of 11 defined terms such as:

==== RDFS

RDF Schema provides a data-modelling vocabulary for RDF data. RDF Schema is an extension of the basic RDF vocabulary.

and

==== coordinate reference system
A coordinate reference system (CRS) is a coordinate system that is related to an object by a datum.

These definitions have been included to clear up ambiguity regarding the origin and exact use of terms in GeoSPARQL.
