== iii. Preface
The OGC GeoSPARQL Standard defines:

* A formal _profile_;
* **this document;**
* A core RDF/OWL ontology for geographic information representation;
* A set of SPARQL extension functions;
* A Functions & Rules vocabulary, derived from the ontology;
* A Simple Features geometry types vocabulary;
* SHACL shapes for RDF data validation.

This document authoritatively defines many of the Standard's elements, including the ontology classes and properties, SPARQL functions, and function and rule vocabulary concepts. Complete descriptions of the Standard's parts and their roles are given in the Introduction in the section <<GeoSPARQL Standard structure>>.

== vi. Clarifications

* The terms <<spatial reference system, Spatial Reference System (SRS)>> and <<coordinate reference system, Coordinate Reference System (CRS)>> are no longer interchangeable. Spatial Reference System is now taken to be a broader category than Coordinate Reference System. These are defined in the <<Terms and definitions>> section.
* Class definitions were updated to be more self-contained and easier to understand for people without a background in geoinformatics. The definitions are no longer dependent on other standards' definitions, only informed by them.
* A section was added on <<Recommendation for units of measure,the specification of units of measurement>>.
* A section was added on the <<Influence of Reference Systems on computations,influence of Reference Systems on computations>>.

== vii. Changes to the OGC® Abstract Specification
