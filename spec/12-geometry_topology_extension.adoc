== Geometry Topology Extension

This clause establishes the _Geometry Topology Extension_ parameterized Requirements class with base IRI `/req/geometry-topology-extension`, which defines a collection of topological query functions that operate on geometry literals. These Requirements are parameterized to give implementations flexibility in the topological relation families and geometry serializations that they choose to support. These Requirements have a single corresponding conformance class _Geometry Topology Extension_, with IRI `/conf/geometry-topology-extension`.

The Dimensionally Extended Nine Intersection Model (DE-9IM) <<DE-9IM>> has been used to define the relation tested by the query functions introduced in this section. Each query function is associated with a defining DE-9IM intersection pattern. Possible pattern values are:

* `-1` (empty)
* `0`, `1`, `2`, `T` (true) = `{0, 1, 2}`
* `F` (false) = `{-1}`
* `*` (don't care) = `{-1, 0, 1, 2}`

In the following descriptions, the notation `X/Y` is used to denote applying a spatial relation to geometry types `X` and `Y` (i.e., `x` _relation_ `y` where `x` is of type `X` and `y` is of type `Y`). The symbol `P` is used for 0-dimensional geometries (e.g. points). The symbol `L` is used for 1- dimensional geometries (e.g. lines), and the symbol `A` is used for 2-dimensional geometries (e.g. polygons). Consult the Simple Features specification <<OGCSFACA>> <<ISO19125-1>> for a more detailed description of DE-9IM intersection patterns.

=== Parameters

* **relation_family**: Specifies the set of topological spatial relations to support.  
* **serialization**: Specifies the serialization standard to use for geometry literals.  
* **version**: Specifies the version of the serialization format used. 

=== Common Query Functions

[#geof:relate]

[#req_geometry_topology_extension_relate_query_function]
|===
| *Req {counter:req}* Implementations shall support
<<Function: geof:relate, `geof:relate`>>
as a SPARQL extension function, consistent with the relate operator defined in Simple Features <<OGCSFACA>> <<ISO19125-1>>.
|<<#conf_geometry_topology_extension_relate_query_function>>
|===

==== Function: geof:relate

```
geof:relate (geom1: ogc:geomLiteral, 
             geom2: ogc:geomLiteral, 
             pattern-matrix: xsd:string): xsd:boolean
```

Returns `true` if the spatial relationship between `geom1` and `geom2` corresponds to one with acceptable values for the specified pattern-matrix. Otherwise, this function returns `false`. `pattern-matrix` represents a DE-9IM intersection pattern consisting of `T` (true) and `F` (false) values. The spatial reference system for `geom1` is used for spatial calculations.

=== Simple Features Relation Family

This clause establishes Requirements for the _Simple Features_ relation family.

[#req_geometry_topology_extension_sf_query_functions]
|===
| *Req {counter:req}* Implementations shall support 
<<geof:sfEquals, `geof:sfEquals`>>,
<<geof:sfDisjoint, `geof:sfDisjoint`>>, 
<<geof:sfIntersects, `geof:sfIntersects`>>, 
<<geof:sfTouches, `geof:sfTouches`>>, 
<<geof:sfCrosses, `geof:sfCrosses`>>, 
<<geof:sfWithin, `geof:sfWithin`>>, 
<<geof:sfContains, `geof:sfContains`>> and 
<<geof:sfOverlaps, `geof:sfOverlaps`>> 
as SPARQL extension functions, consistent with their corresponding DE-9IM intersection patterns, as defined by Simple Features <<OGCSFACA>> <<ISO19125-1>>.
<<#conf_geometry_topology_extension_sf_query_functions>>
|===

Boolean query functions defined for the Simple Features relation family, along with their associated DE-9IM intersection patterns, are shown in <<simple_features_query_functions>> below. Multi-row intersection patterns should be interpreted as a logical OR of each row. Each function accepts two arguments (`geom1` and `geom2`) of the geometry literal _serialization_ type _specified_ by serialization and version. Each function returns an http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean[`xsd:boolean`] value of `true` if the specified relation exists between `geom1` and `geom2` and returns false otherwise. In each case, the spatial reference system of `geom1` is used for spatial calculations.
