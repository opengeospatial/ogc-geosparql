== Future Work

Many future extensions of this standard are possible and, since the release of GeoSPARQL 1.0, many extensions have been made. 

The GeoSPARQL 1.1 release incorporates many additions requested of the GeoSPARQL 1.0 Standard, including the use of particular new serializations: where GeoSPARQL 1.0 supported GML & WKT, GeoSPARQL 1.1 also supports GeoJSON, KML and a generic DGGS literal. GeoSPARQL 1.1 also supports spatial scalar properties. 

Plans for future GeoSPARQL releases have been mooted but won't be articulated here, instead they will be discussed and decided apon by the OGC GeoSPARQL Standards Working Group and related groups. Readers of this document are encouraged to seek out those groups' lists of issues and standards change requests rather than looking for ideas here that will surely age badly.
