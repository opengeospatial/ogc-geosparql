== Conformance
Conformance with this specification shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in _Annex A — Abstract Test Suite_. The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in _ISO 19105: Geographic information — Conformance and Testing_ <<ISO19105>>.

This document establishes several requirements classes and corresponding conformance classes (a conformance class is a set of tests for each requirement in a requirements class). Any GeoSPARQL implementation claiming conformance with one of the conformance classes shall pass all the tests in the associated abstract test suite.

Requirements and conformance tests have IRIs that are relative to versioned namespace IRIs. Requirements and conformance test that are defined in GeoSPARQL 1.0 have IRIs relative to  `http://www.opengis.net/spec/geosparql/1.0/`, requirements and conformance test that are added in GeoSPARQL 1.1 have IRIs relative to  `http://www.opengis.net/spec/geosparql/1.1/`.

Many conformance classes are parameterized. For parameterized conformance classes, the list of parameters is given within parenthesis.

Dependencies between each GeoSPARQL requirements class are shown below in Figure 2. To support a requirements class for a given set of parameter values, an implementation must support each dependent requirements class with the same set of parameter values.
