== CQL / GeoSPARQL Mapping

[discrete]
=== F.0. Overview

This annex presents a mapping between the Common Query Language(CQL) <<CQLDEF>> and GeoSPARQL as well as generic SPARQL <<SPARQL>>. This is likely of relevance to the delivery of GeoSPARQL data via systems such as the OGC's Web Feature Service <<WFS>> and OGC API Features <<OGCAPIF>> which implement CQL.

=== Accessing spatial Features in a SPARQL endpoint

Spatial _Features_ accessed via SPARQL endpoints <<SPARQLPROT>> are, as defined in the GeoSPARQL standard, instances of the OWL class <<Class: geo:Feature, `geo:Feature`>> or of subclasses of it.
They may have one or more <<Property: geo:hasGeometry, `geo:hasGeometry`>> properties indicating <<Class: geo:Geometry, `geo:Geometry`>> instances and other properties related to the Feature. They may also be grouped into <<Class: geo:FeatureCollection, `geo:FeatureCollection`>> instances where <<Property: geo:FeatureCollection, `geo:FeatureCollection`>> is a new class in GeoSPARQL 1.1, specifically for the description of collections of <<Class: geo:Feature, `geo:Feature`>> instances.

The following example SPARQL query retrieves all Features within the Feature Collection with the IRI `ex:x` within a given SPARQL endpoint.

[%unnumbered]
```turtle
SELECT ?fcollection ?item ?rel ?val ?geom 
WHERE {
  ex:x rdfs:member ?item .
  ?item rdfs:subClassOf* geo:Feature .
}
```

GeoSPARQL's <<Class: geo:FeatureCollection, `geo:FeatureCollection`>> definition requires that <<Class: geo:Feature, `geo:Feature`>> instances are to be linked to the Collection by use of the http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#member[``rdf:member``] property. No inverse property is defined.

[NOTE]
====
Some CQL-implementing systems, such as OGC API, have fixed notions of Feature Collections and require that Features be members of exactly one Feature Collection. There is no such restriction in GeoSPARQL: Features may be members of one or more Feature Collections.
====

An extension to the above can retrieve any Geometry serializations for the Features within Feature Collection `ex:x`:

[%unnumbered]
```turtle
SELECT ?fcollection ?item ?rel ?val ?geom 
WHERE {
  ex:x rdfs:member ?item .
  ?item rdfs:subClassOf* geo:Feature .

  OPTIONAL {
    ?item geo:hasGeometry/geo:hasSerialization ?geom
  }
}
```

Some additional concerns for GeoSPARQL / CQL or OGC API Features Feature Collections mappings are:

* APIs may need more information about the <<Class: geo:FeatureCollection, `geo:FeatureCollection`>> instance for correct handling, in particular, an identifier and perhaps a label. If the back-end data store also contains information for the <<Class: geo:FeatureCollection, `geo:FeatureCollection`>> instance then this may be queried for. If not, the API might need to create such data
** One particular scenario observed is that OGC APIs require token-like identifiers for Feature Collections and GeoSPARQL IRIs, or their parts, may not be able to be used for such. In these cases, the RDF property http://purl.org/dc/terms/identifier[`dcterms:identifier`] may be used to store appropriate token-like identifiers
* Perhaps only data in a certain namespace is of interest. The solution is to apply FILTER expressions to the SPARQL query

=== Mappings from CQL2 statements to GeoSPARQL queries

This section presents lists of equivalences between Common Query Language (CQL2) <<CQLDEF>> statements and GeoSPARQL statements.

==== Query Parameters

Several query parameters may be given as parameters to the HTTP request of CD-implementing systems, such as the OGC API Features service. These parameters have an influence on the SPARQL query to be executed for the retrieval of a FeatureCollection to be exposed using an OGC API Features service.

.CQL To GeoSPARQL Mappings: Query Parameters
[cols="1,1,1,1,3"]
|===
| Query Parameter | Example | SPARQL Expression | Example | Comment

| limit  | limit=5 | LIMIT | LIMIT 5 |
| offset  | offset=10 | OFFSET | OFFSET 10 |
| bbox | ``bbox=
160.6,-55.95,-170,-25.89`` | ``FILTER(
geo:sfIntersects())`` | ``FILTER(geo:sfIntersects(?geom, "POLYGON( (160.6 -55.95,160.6 -25.89, -170 -25.89, -170 -55.95, 160.6 -55.95))"^^geo:wktLiteral)``
) | WKT does not define a type boundingbox, therefore a bbox is converted to a Polygon
| datetime | ``datetime= 2018-02-12 T23%3A20%3A52Z`` | - | - | GeoSPARQL doesn't detail temporal aspects of data. Filtering data using RDF temporal properties may be achieved using basic SPARQL queries and also OWL TIME <<TIME>>
|===


==== Literal Values

CQL2 defines literal values for a variety of datatypes. The following table shows the equivalences of these values in RDF which may be used in any GeoSPARQL query.

.CQL To GeoSPARQL Mappings: Literal Values
|===
| CQL2 literal | Examples  | (Geo)SPARQL literal | Examples

| String  | "This is a string" | http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string[``xsd:string``] | "This is a string"^^xsd:string 
| Number  | -100  3.14159 | http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int[``xsd:int``], http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer[``xsd:integer``], http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#double[``xsd:double``] | "-100"^^xsd:integer  "3.14159"^^xsd:double 
| Boolean  | true false | http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean[``xsd:boolean``] | "true"^^xsd:boolean  "false"^^xsd:boolean 
| Spatial Geometry (WKT)  | POINT(1 1) | <<RDFS Datatype: geo:wktLiteral, WKT Literal>> | "POINT(1 1)"^^geo:wktLiteral
| Spatial Geometry (JSON)  | {"type": "Point", "coordinates":[1,1]} | <<RDFS Datatype: geo:geoJSONLiteral, GeoJSON Literal>> | "{"type": "Point", "coordinates":[1,1]}"^^geo:geoJSONLiteral
| Temporal Literal  | 1969-07-20  1969-07-20T20:17:40Z | http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date[``xsd:date``], http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime[``xsd:dateTime``], http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTimeStamp[``xsd:dateTimeStamp``] | "1969-07-20"^^xsd:date "1969-07-20T20:17:40Z"^^xsd:dateTime
|===

==== Property references

CQL2 allows the referencing of properties in a Feature Collection it is targeting for filtering. A property reference is converted to a triple pattern as shown in the following example. A SPARQL variable ``?item`` is assumed to represent the Feature Collection.

.CQL To GeoSPARQL Mappings: Property references
|===
| Property Reference  | Triple pattern

| name="OGC" | ``?item my:name "OGC"^^xsd:string``
| number=5 | ``?item my:number "5"^^xsd:integer``
| number>5 | ``?item my:number ?number . FILTER(?number>5)``
|===

==== Comparison Predicates

CQL2 defines comparison predicates to compare two scalar expressions. A comparison predicate is converted to a triple pattern as shown in the following example. A SPARQL variable `?item` is assumed to represent the Feature Collection.

.CQL To GeoSPARQL Mappings: Comparison Predicates
|===
| Comparison predicate  | Triple pattern | Comment

| name="OGC" | `?item my:name "OGC"^^xsd:string` | Equality statements can be converted to a triple pattern
| number=5 | ``?item my:number "5"^^xsd:integer`` | 
| number>5 | ?item my:number ?number . FILTER(?number>5) | Arithmetic comparisons (<,>,>=,<=) are converted to filter expressions
| number BETWEEN 5 AND 10 | `?item my:number ?number . FILTER(?number>=5 && ?number<=10)` | BETWEEN statements are converted to arithmetic expressions
| name IN ("OGC","W3C") | `?item my:name IN ("OGC", "W3C")` | IN statements may also be expressed using SPARQL VALUES statements
| name IS NOT NULL | `EXISTS {?item my:name ?name }` | NOT NULL statements are converted to EXIST statements
| name LIKE "OGC." | `?item my:name ?name . FILTER(regex(?name, "OGC.", "i" ))` | LIKE statements are converted to SPARQL regex filters
| INTERSECTS(geometry1, geometry2) | `FILTER(geof:sfIntersects(?geometry1,?geometry2))` | The INTERSECTS filter statement is converted to a GeoSPARQL FILTER statement
|===

There is no direct GeoSPARQL equivalent to a CRS-based CQL filter, however certain GeoSPARQL geometry literals have explicity CRS/SRS information that may be filtered using SPARQL `REGEX` operators.

==== Spatial Operators

GeoSPARQL includes equivalents of many CQL2 filter functions as can be seen in the table below.

.CQL To GeoSPARQL Mappings: Spatial Operators
|===
| CQL2 Filter Expression  | GeoSPARQL Filter Function 

| CONTAINS(geometry1,geometry2)  | FILTER(geof:sfContains(?geometry1,?geometry2))  
| CROSSES(geometry1,geometry2)  | FILTER(geof:sfCrosses(?geometry1,?geometry2))  
| DISJOINT(geometry1,geometry2)  | FILTER(geof:sfDisjoint(?geometry1,?geometry2)) 
| EQUALS(geometry1,geometry2)  | FILTER(geof:sfEquals(?geometry1,?geometry2))  
| INTERSECTS(geometry1,geometry2)  | FILTER(geof:sfIntersects(?geometry1,?geometry2)) 
| OVERLAPS(geometry1,geometry2)  | FILTER(geof:sfOverlaps(?geometry1,?geometry2))  
| TOUCHES(geometry1,geometry2)  | FILTER(geof:sfTouches(?geometry1,?geometry2))  
| WITHIN(geometry1,geometry2)  | FILTER(geof:sfWithin(?geometry1,?geometry2))  
|===

==== Temporal Operators

Temporal operators are not part of the GeoSPARQL standard.

| beginTime AFTER 1969-07-16T13:32:00Z | N/A

| beginTime TOVERLAPS 1969-07-16T13:32:00Z | N/A
|===

As noted above in Section <<F.2.1 Query Parameters, F.2.1 Query Parameters>>, temporal filtering of RDF data via SPARQL queries is possible with standard SPARQL functions to compare date values (http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date[`xsd:date`], http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime[`xsd:dateTime`] and http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTimeStamp[`xsd:dateTimeStamp`] literals) and OWL TIME <<TIME>> may be used to assert temporal relations between objects.
