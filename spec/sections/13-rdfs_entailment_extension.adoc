== RDFS Entailment Extension

This clause establishes the _RDFS Entailment Extension_ parameterized Requirements class with base IRI `/req/rdfs-entailment-extension`, which defines a mechanism for matching implicitly-derived RDF triples in GeoSPARQL queries. This class is parameterized to give implementations flexibility in the topological relation families and geometry types that they choose to support. These Requirements have a single corresponding conformance class _RDFS Entailment Extension_, `with IRI /conf/rdfs-entailment-extension`.

=== Common Requirements

The basic mechanism for supporting RDFS entailment has been defined by the W3C SPARQL 1.1 RDFS Entailment Regime <<SPARQLENT>>.

=== WKT Serialization

This section establishes the requirements for representing geometry data in RDF based on WKT as defined by Simple Features <<OGCSFACA>> <<ISO19125-1>>.

==== Geometry Class Hierarchy

The Simple Features specification presents a geometry class hierarchy. It is straightforward to represent this class hierarchy in RDFS and OWL by constructing IRIs for geometry classes using the following pattern: `+http://www.opengis.net/ont/sf#{geometry class}+` and by asserting appropriate http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf[`rdfs:subClassOf`] statements. The _Simple Features Vocabulary_ resource within GeoSPARQL 1.1 (sibling resource to this specification) does this. The following list gives the class hierarchy with each indented item being a subclass of the item in the line above. The class hierarchy starts with GeoSPARQL's `geo:Geometry` class of which http://www.opengis.net/ont/sf#Geometry[`sf:Geometry`] is a subclass:

[%unnumbered]
```
geo:Geometry
    sf:Geometry
        sf:Curve
            sf:LineString
                sf:Line
                sf:LinearRing
        sf:GeometryCollection
            sf:MultiCurve
                sf:MultiLineString
            sf:MultiPoint
            sf:MultiSurface
                sf:MultiPolygon
        sf:Point
        sf:Surface
            sf:Polygon
                sf:Envelope
                sf:Triangle
            sf:PolyhedralSurface
                sf:TIN
```

The following example RDF snippet below encodes the _Simple Features vocabulary_ Polygon class:

[%unnumbered]
```turtle
sf:Polygon 
    a rdfs:Class, owl:Class ;
    rdfs:isDefinedBy <http://www.opengis.net/ont/sf> ;
    skos:prefLabel "Polygon"@en ;
    rdfs:subClassOf sf:Surface ;
    skos:definition "A planar surface defined by 1 exterior boundary and 0 or 
                    more interior boundaries"@en ;
.
```

[requirement,identifier="/req/rdfs-entailment-extension/wkt-geometry-types"]
.WKT Geometry Types
====
Implementations shall support graph patterns involving terms from an RDFS/OWL class hierarchy of geometry types consistent with the one in the specified version of Simple Features <<OGCSFACA>> <<ISO19125-1>>.
====

[[rdfse_gml]]
=== GML Serialization

This section establishes Requirements for representing geometry data in RDF based on GML as defined by Geography Markup Language Encoding Standard <<OGC07-036>>.

==== Geometry Class Hierarchy

An RDF/OWL class hierarchy can be generated from the GML schema that implements `GM_Object` by constructing IRIs for geometry classes using the following pattern: `+http://www.opengis.net/ont/gml#{GML Element}+` and by asserting appropriate http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf[`rdfs:subClassOf`] statements.

The example RDF snippet below encodes the Polygon class from GML 3.2.

[%unnumbered]
```turtle
gml:Polygon 
    a rdfs:Class, owl:Class ;
    skos:prefLabel "Polygon"@en ;
    rdfs:subClassOf gml:SurfacePatch ;
    skos:definition "A planar surface defined by 1 exterior boundary and 0 or
                    more interior boundaries."@en ;
.
```
