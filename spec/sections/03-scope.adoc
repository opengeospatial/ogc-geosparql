== Scope

The GeoSPARQL Standard comprises multiple parts. See the Introduction section <<GeoSPARQL Standard structure>> for details of the parts.

GeoSPARQL does not define a comprehensive vocabulary for representing spatial information. Instead, it defines a core set of classes, properties and datatypes that can be used to construct query patterns. Many useful extensions to this vocabulary are possible, and we intend for the Semantic Web and Geospatial communities to develop additional vocabularies for describing spatial information.
