== Scope
This is the specification document for GeoSPARQL which, as a whole, comprises multiple parts. See the Introduction section <<GeoSPARQL Standard structure>> for details of the parts.

GeoSPARQL does not define a comprehensive vocabulary for representing spatial information. It instead defines a core set of classes, properties and datatypes that can be used to construct query patterns. Many useful extensions to this vocabulary are possible, and we intend for the Semantic Web and Geographic Information System (GIS) communities to develop additional vocabulary for describing spatial information.
