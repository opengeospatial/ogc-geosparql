== Topology Vocabulary Extension

This clause establishes the _Topology Vocabulary Extension_ parameterized Requirements class. The IRI base is `/req/topology-vocab-extension`, which has a single corresponding Conformance Class _Topology Vocabulary Extension_, with IRI `/conf/topology-vocab-extension`. This Requirements class defines a vocabulary for asserting and querying topological relations between spatial objects. The class is parameterized so that different families of topological relations may be used, such as RCC8 and Egenhofer. These relations are generalized so that they may connect features as well as geometries.

====

A Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model <<DE-9IM>> pattern, which specifies the spatial dimension of the intersections of the interiors, boundaries and exteriors of two geometric objects, is used to describe each spatial relation. Possible pattern values are `-1 (empty)`, `0, 1, 2, T (true) = {0, 1, 2}`, `F (false) = {-1}`, `* (don't care) = {-1, 0, 1, 2}`. In the following descriptions, the notation `X/Y` is used to denote applying a spatial relation to geometry types `X` and `Y` (i.e., `x` _relation_ `y` where `x` is of type `X` and `y` is of type `Y`). The symbol `P` is used for 0-dimensional geometries (e.g. points). The symbol `L` is used for 1-dimensional geometries (e.g. lines), and the symbol `A` is used for 2-dimensional geometries (e.g. polygons). Consult the Simple Features specification <<OGCSFACA>> <<ISO19125-1>> for a more detailed description of DE-9IM intersection patterns.

=== Parameters

The following parameter is defined for the _Topology Vocabulary Extension_ Requirements.

*relation_family*: Specifies the set of topological spatial relations to support.
