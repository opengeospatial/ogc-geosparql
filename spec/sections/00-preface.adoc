== Abstract 

GeoSPARQL contains a small spatial domain ontology that allow literal representations of geometries to be associated with spatial features and for features to be associated with other features using spatial relations.

GeoSPARQL also contains SPARQL extension function definitions that can be used to calculate relations between spatial objects.

Several other supporting assets are also contained within GeoSPARQL such as vocabularies of Simple Feature types and data validators.
