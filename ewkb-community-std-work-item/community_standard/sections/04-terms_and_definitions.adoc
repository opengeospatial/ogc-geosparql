=== ZM-Geometry

a) A geometry can have either 2, 3 or 4 dimensions.
b) 3rd dimension of a 3d geometry can either represent Z or M (3DZ or 3DM).
c) 4d geometries contain both Z and M (in this order).
d) M and Z values are associated with every vertex.
e) M and Z values are undefined within surface interiors.

Any ZM-Geometry can be converted into a 2D geometry by discarding all its
Z and M values. The resulting 2D geometry is the "shadow" of the ZM-Geometry.
2D geometries cannot be safely converted into ZM-Geometries, since their Z
and M values are undefined, and not necessarily zero.
